Momentum MomEngine_64 2022.00.265 (*) built: Jul  2 2021
Copyright  1992 - 2021 Keysight Technologies
Simulation started on: Wed Sep 28 18:05:06 2022
Simulation Mode: uW
Substrate valid
Using the minimal snap distance of 0.004 um
(4 layout resolution points) for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.004 um.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.
